        <p>EFT is usually short term (8-20 sessions ) , structured approach to couples therapy formulated by Drs . Sue Johnson and Les Greenberg . A substantial body of research outlining EFT effectiveness now exists. Research studies find that 70-75 % of couples move from distress to recovery and approximately 90 % show significant improvements .</p>

<p>The aim of the emotion -focused therapy is the quality of the emotional connection between the two partners. The quality of the connection is always good in the beginning of any relationship. In the first stage , which I call "Stage 1 - You are the answer, " began intensely connected and responsive to our partners . Biology, love hormones , idealization , focus, consistency and elimination of conflicts are the five qualities that make you feel like a new relationship BLISS .</p>

<p>But the problem for couples will be developed in Stage 2 - "You are the problem " due to several factors. Love Hormones Stage 1 produces a less potent magic . Our level of care tends to decrease. And our desire to reveal our uniqueness (rather than our sameness ) produces differences between two partners ... and conflict. The quality of the connection between the partners can go to feel safe to feel very insecure.</p>
