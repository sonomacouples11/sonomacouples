","body":"EFT is usually short term (8-20 sessions ) , structured approach to couples therapy formulated by Drs . Sue Johnson and Les Greenberg .

The quality of the connection is always good in the beginning of any relationship. In the first stage , which I call \"Stage 1 - You are the answer, \" began intensely connected and responsive to our partners . Biology, love hormones , idealization , focus, consistency and elimination of conflicts are the five qualities that make you feel like a new relationship BLISS .\r\n\r\nBut the problem for couples will be developed in Stage 2 - \"You are the problem \" due to several factors. Love Hormones Stage 1 produces a less potent magic . Our level of care tends to decrease.
